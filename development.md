#Contributing to Apiko

## How to start

It would be nice if you will follow [git-flow](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh) concept.
You can use some software like [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) to help yourself with it.

Now we use git-flow branches: hotfix and feature. Choose one of it

All pull requests should be done to the branch _**develop**_

## Short cheat-sheet 
1. Fork project
2. Choose a small part you want to fix in or add to project
3. Use development branch for your code
4. Install all current packages `yarn install`
5. Make your local branch for your feature or hotfix
6. Code, test
7. Make a Pull Request to **_'develop'_** branch

## Standards and rules

Project uses [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/feross/standard)

Warnings are possible but try to avoid them.

## Tests

It's really good when you cover your code with tests.
Project uses [mocha](https://mochajs.org)-[chai](http://chaijs.com)-[sinon](http://sinonjs.org). 
Use it!
